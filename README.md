Machine Learning is a automation type which is ruled based automation system and traditional programmed.
It is branch of computer which gives computer the ability to learn without being explicity programmed.
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial 
intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed 
to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is 
difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
